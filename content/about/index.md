Hello people, **GreyCipher** here.

I'm building my foundation in cybersecurity, with a focus on defensive
security and structured problem-solving. My work revolves around
understanding systems, analyzing behavior, and expanding into DFIR,
OSINT, reverse engineering, and tool development.

What fascinates me is how complex environments collapse into clear
patterns once you know where to look. How systems fail, how they can
be read efficiently, how noise becomes signal.

This blog is a public notebook. I document what I study, test, and
break, not as finished authority, but as work in progress.

Writing forces clarity. Sharing keeps knowledge from dying in a
private folder.

Curiosity drives the rest.
